## Threecolts Ruby hiring test

### The process

Please implement the 2 functions as described in the lib/threecolts_lib.rb file.

Requirements:

- Do not edit the Gemfile/.rspec file. In particular, do not add any libraries to it
- threecolts_lib.rb should not have compiler errors
- All your code should exist within a single file: lib/threecolts_lib.rb
- If you write tests, these can live in a separate file. You can use rspec for them

At the end of the hour, please:

- Attach your solution threecolts_lib.rb to the email
- Optional: if you wrote any tests, please attach them to the same email

If you have any questions take your best guess.
After delivering the solution, feel free to send comments or questions our way,

Best of luck,
The Threecolts team
